##################### About Me #####################

Hello,

My name is Nathan Urban-Gedamke and I am a developer and Polymath. My primary code skills like in SQL development, specifically Microsoft's T-SQL, but I have in the past used Java, C#, C, JavaScript, R, HTML, CSS, Powershell, and XML. Really whatever tool is needed for the job at hand. I love learning, so picking up a new language is nothing daunting for me, so long as I have an interesting project to develop while learning.

Outside of programming, I enjoy Historical European Martial Arts, woodworking, leatherworking, electronics, design, and connecting people.

Feel free to reach out if you want to connect. You can find me on Linkedin, or email me at MedievaliITGuy@Gmail.com

Never stop learning,
~Nathan
